### Change Log

**v0.9.0** - 12/4/2018
- Initial release

___
### Known Issues

- **Issue:** If Mount Muzzle is selected to automatically load and the player is mounted upon login, there is a significant delay before the chosen music will begin to play.
- **Issue:** Upon changing zones the default music can be heard for a moment before the chosen music begins to play.
- **Issue:** Unable to correctly set mount music to original if Mount Muzzle is unloaded while mounted. 

___    
### TODOs

- **TODO:** Investigate alternative methods for music change as packet injection/swap allows the player to hear the default music upon zone change and login, regardless of chosen music.
- **TODO:** Investigate methods for determining which mount type the player is on when loading/unloading Mount Muzzle.
